1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
The world is changed.

2
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:41,047
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,725
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,311
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,597
Much that once was...

6
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,357
is lost.

7
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:57,105
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:14,379
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,464
Three were given to the Elves:

10
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,459
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

11
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:23,587
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:28,761
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,473
And nine...

14
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:33,689
nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...

15
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,731
who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:38,862 --> 00:01:44,069
For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:48,746
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,075
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:55,499
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,382
the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,632
to control all others.

22
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,795
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:11,226
and his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:16,054
One Ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,270
One by one...

26
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:23,439
the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,691
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:31,821
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,666
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,613
Victory was near.

31
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,117
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,370
could not be undone.

33
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,893
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,483
when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:51,826
that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:29,401
Sauron, the enemy of the Free
Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,445
The Ring passed to Isildur...

38
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:42,875
who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,709
But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:48,412
are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:53,300
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:21,116
It betrayed Isildur...

43
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,365
to his death.

44
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:33,416
And some things that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,959
were lost.

46
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,010
History became legend...

47
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:41,215
legend became myth.

48
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,269
And for two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,180
the Ring passed out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:51,651
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,439
it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:58,342
My precious.

53
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:04,363
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...

54
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,495
who took it deep into the
tunnels of the Misty Mountains.

55
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,664
And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,921
It came to me.

57
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:18,547
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:20,324
My precious.

59
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:30,521
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,566
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,355
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

62
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,823
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:45,914
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,911
whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:52,412
And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,416
its time had now come.

67
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:00,512
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,677
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,095
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:12,344
What's this?

71
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,975
A Hobbit.

72
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,942
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,896
A ring.

74
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:20,113
Lost!

75
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,194
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,703
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:35,120
when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:42,919
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:46,339
in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,799
by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:54,772
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West farthing...

82
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,974
the Shire...

83
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:00,028
Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:07,994
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:23,546
There and Back Again:

86
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:25,886
A Hobbit's Tale.

87
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:30,010
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,599
Now...

89
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,310
where to begin?

90
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:41,643
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:47,988
"Concerning...

92
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,696
Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,330
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

94
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,500
for many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,664
quite content to ignore and be ignored...

96
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,048
by the world of the Big Folk.

97
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:10,014
Middle-earth being, after all, full
of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:13,391
Hobbits must seem of little importance...

99
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:17,597
being neither renowned as great warriors...

100
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:21,975
nor counted among the very wise.

101
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:29,365
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:33,114
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,742
that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

104
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,285
A rather unfair observation...

105
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:44,169
as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

106
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:47,342
and the smoking of pipe-weed.

107
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:50,636
But where our hearts truly lie...

108
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:52,920
is in peace and quiet...

109
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,799
and good, tilled earth.

110
00:09:56,018 --> 00:10:01,178
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

111
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:08,688
And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.

112
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:14,151
But today of all days, it is brought home to me:

113
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:20,698
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

114
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:28,041
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,760
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:35,679
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:45,015
Down from the door where it began

118
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,562
And I must follow if I can

119
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:58,703
The road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:02,365
Down from the door where it began

121
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:07,541
Now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:11,962
- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

123
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:19,048
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:24,475
Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:38,908
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,491
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:50,336
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:54,379
I hear it's going to be a
party of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:56,999
You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:59,128
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,220
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,096
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

133
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:10,557
And so life in the Shire goes on...

134
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:13,776
very much as it has this past Age...

135
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:19,492
full of its own comings and
goings, with change coming slowly.

136
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,493
If it comes at all.

137
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:26,286
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

138
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:29,997
passing from one generation to the next.

139
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:35,377
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

140
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:36,920
in Bag End.

141
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,465
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,598
To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:50,060
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,982
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

145
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:58,730
He spends hours poring over old
maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,120
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,021
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,655
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,586
But I know you have something to do with it.

150
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:55,869
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,090
Before you came along, we
Bagginses were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:00,212
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,714
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:09,175
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,926
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:17,273
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,523
Oh, really?

158
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:27,151
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,530
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,248
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:00,140
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:04,812
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,068
So am I.

164
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,311
No, thank you!

165
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:48,477
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,197
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,079
Gandalf?

168
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,208
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

169
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:06,544
Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it?

170
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,292
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,932
Come on, come in!

172
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,516
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,409
Oh, here we are.

174
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,308
Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?

175
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:33,315
I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

176
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,579
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:43,206
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,086
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,135
I was expecting you sometime last week.

180
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,630
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

181
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:03,056
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

182
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,641
There's some cheese here. No, that won't do.

183
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,772
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart...

184
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:15,441
But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right.

185
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:18,492
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,701
I could make you some eggs if you'd...

187
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:29,213
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

188
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,622
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

189
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,593
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

190
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,382
I'm not at home!

191
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,966
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

192
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,262
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

193
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,432
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

194
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,403
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

195
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:56,570
never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:57,282 --> 00:18:00,782
I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf!

197
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:05,537
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

198
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:09,665
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

199
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,121
All the arrangements are made.

200
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:15,715
Oh, thank you.

201
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,547
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,216
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:24,053
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.

204
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,394
You will tell him, won't you?

205
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,311
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

206
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:34,067
I know.

207
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,780
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

208
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:43,825
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

209
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:47,696
The woods, the fields.

210
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,239
Little rivers.

211
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:57,418
I am old, Gandalf.

212
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,049
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

213
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,715
I feel thin.

214
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,645
Sort of stretched...

215
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:15,225
like butter scraped over too much bread.

216
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:19,937
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

217
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:23,357
And I don't expect I shall return.

218
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,781
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,538
Old Toby. The finest weed in the South farthing.

220
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:55,431
Gandalf, my old friend...

221
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,484
this will be a night to remember.

222
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,377
Hello, hello.

223
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:26,676
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome.

224
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,260
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:36,428
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

226
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:39,272
Go on!

227
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:51,237
So there I was...

228
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:55,497
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

229
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,698
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

230
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,289
about how they were going to cook us.

231
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:05,546
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

232
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:10,086
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,887
that the sun's first light crept
over the top of the trees...

234
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:17,385
and turned them all to stone!

235
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:24,062
Quickly.

236
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,277
Up they go!

237
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:34,360
No, the big one.

238
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:46,380
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice
to see you. Welcome, welcome.

239
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,466
Are all these children yours?

240
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:51,678
Good gracious, you have been productive.

241
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:55,011
Bilbo?

242
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,432
Sackville-Bagginses!

243
00:21:58,643 --> 00:21:59,722
Quickly, hide!

244
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,813
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:15,651
You're a good lad, Frodo.

246
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,742
I'm very selfish, you know.

247
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:23,666
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

248
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:26,162
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

249
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,880
but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:29,833
I think it was because...

251
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,373
of all my numerous relations...

252
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:36,178
you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

253
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,264
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:39,267
No.

255
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:43,051
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:46,557
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,652
you'll be all right.

258
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:57,073
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:22:57,286 --> 00:22:58,745
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

260
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:00,495
This was your idea.

261
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:17,887
Bilbo.

262
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,802
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

263
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:25,388
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

264
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:42,486
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

265
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,285
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

266
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,376
I might've known.

267
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,337
Speech, Bilbo!

268
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:00,502
Speech!

269
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:01,755
Speech!

270
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:09,261
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

271
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:12,223
Tooks and Brandybucks...

272
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:14,932
Grubbs, Chubbs...

273
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:16,184
Hornblowers...

274
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:19,024
Bolgers...

275
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:20,950
Bracegirdles...

276
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,780
- and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

277
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:29,124
Today is my 111th birthday!

278
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,463
Happy birthday!

279
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:36,916
But alas, eleventy-one years is far
too short a time to live among...

280
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:40,049
such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

281
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,722
I don't know half of you half
as well as I should like...

282
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:48,511
and I like less than half of
you half as well as you deserve.

283
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:00,862
I have things to do.

284
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:09,368
I've put this off far too long.

285
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,160
I regret to announce this is the end!

286
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,504
I'm going now.

287
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:23,504
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

288
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:27,087
Goodbye.

289
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,461
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

290
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:07,012
Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces?

291
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:12,262
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

292
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,634
It was just a bit of fun.

293
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:18,555
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

294
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:23,478
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

295
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:26,366
As often as I can spare them.

296
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:29,741
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

297
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:33,288
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

298
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,783
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

299
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:41,831
No. Wait, it's...

300
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,045
here in my pocket.

301
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:54,885
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

302
00:26:56,562 --> 00:27:00,061
Yet, after all, why not?

303
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:06,485
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

304
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:09,065
Is that so hard?

305
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:10,613
Well, no.

306
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:13,745
And yes.

307
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:19,582
Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it.

308
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,537
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

309
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:25,966
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

310
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:28,216
It's mine.

311
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:30,309
My own.

312
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:36,255
- My precious.
- Precious?

313
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:39,348
It's been called that before, but not by you.

314
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:42,143
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

315
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:45,107
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

316
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:48,151
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

317
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:52,611
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

318
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:56,490
I am not trying to rob you.

319
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,209
I'm trying to help you.

320
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:15,012
All your long years, we've been friends.

321
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,553
Trust me as you once did.

322
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,260
Let it go.

323
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:24,810
You're right, Gandalf.

324
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,606
The ring must go to Frodo.

325
00:28:30,946 --> 00:28:33,900
It's late. The road is long.

326
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:36,608
Yes, it is time.

327
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:44,408
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

328
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,154
I've thought up an ending for my book:

329
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:28,785
"And he lived happily ever
after to the end of his days."

330
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:32,420
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

331
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:34,925
Goodbye, Gandalf.

332
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:40,299
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

333
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:52,351
The road goes ever on and on

334
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:57,311
Until our next meeting.

335
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,258
It's mine. My own.

336
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:31,930
My precious.

337
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,108
Riddles in the dark.

338
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,729
Bilbo!

339
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:38,487
Bilbo!

340
00:30:42,117 --> 00:30:45,071
My precious.

341
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:48,871
Precious.

342
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,622
He's gone, hasn't he?

343
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:57,462
He talked for so long about leaving...

344
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,377
I didn't think he'd really do it.

345
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:06,757
Gandalf?

346
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:16,683
Bilbo's ring.

347
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:19,399
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

348
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,698
He's left you Bag End.

349
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:28,817
Along with all his possessions.

350
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:31,954
The ring is yours now.

351
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,995
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

352
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:40,456
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

353
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:44,968
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

354
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:48,467
I don't understand.

355
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,801
Neither do I.

356
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:58,352
Keep it secret.

357
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,356
Keep it safe.

358
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:36,071
Shire!

359
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:38,654
Baggins!

360
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:32,408
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

361
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:36,994
Here follows the account of
Isildur, High King of Gondor...

362
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:40,871
and the finding of the Ring of Power."

363
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,207
"It has come to me.

364
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,874
The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

365
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:53,509
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

366
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:57,506
for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.

367
00:33:57,726 --> 00:34:00,218
It is precious to me...

368
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,725
though I buy it with great pain.

369
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:11,071
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

370
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:16,115
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

371
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:20,372
A secret now that only fire can tell."

372
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:37,968
Shire.

373
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:42,049
Baggins.

374
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,606
There's no Bagginses around
here. They're all up in Hobbiton.

375
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:49,811
That way.

376
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,983
To heal my heart and drown my woe

377
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:00,492
Rain may fall and wind may blow

378
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:02,616
But there still be

379
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,244
Many miles to go

380
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,368
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

381
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:08,742
And the stream that falls From hill to plain

382
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:10,795
Better than rain or rippling brook

383
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,376
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

384
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:19,632
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

385
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:23,930
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

386
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:25,811
War is brewing.

387
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,349
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

388
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:32,140
Far-off tales and children's
stories, that's all that is.

389
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:36,822
You're beginning to sound like that
old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

390
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,985
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

391
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:41,576
And proud of it.

392
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:44,027
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

393
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:48,327
It's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

394
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:52,837
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

395
00:35:56,216 --> 00:35:58,376
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

396
00:35:58,595 --> 00:36:03,055
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

397
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:05,593
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

398
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:10,353
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows
an idiot when she sees one.

399
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:12,553
Does she?

400
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:16,226
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mister Frodo.

401
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,459
Is it secret? Is it safe?

402
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:54,478
What are you doing?

403
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,618
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

404
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:10,995
It's quite cool.

405
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:16,293
What can you see?

406
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:20,453
Can you see anything?

407
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:24,553
Nothing.

408
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,214
There's nothing.

409
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:29,801
Wait.

410
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,137
There are markings.

411
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:41,020
It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.

412
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,812
There are few who can.

413
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:49,192
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

414
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:50,859
Mordor!

415
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:53,155
In the common tongue, it says:

416
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:56,874
"One Ring to rule them all...

417
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,412
One Ring to find them...

418
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,836
One Ring to bring them all...

419
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,127
and in the darkness bind them."

420
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:08,801
This is the One Ring...

421
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:14,258
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

422
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:18,521
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

423
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,846
Bilbo found it.

424
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:24,234
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

425
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:28,990
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

426
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,570
prolonging his life, delaying old age.

427
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:37,624
But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor.

428
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,241
The Ring has awoken.

429
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:43,216
It's heard its master's call.

430
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:47,291
But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.

431
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:55,090
No, Frodo.

432
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:59,346
The spirit of Sauron endured.

433
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:04,902
His life force is bound to the
Ring, and the Ring survived.

434
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:07,359
Sauron has returned.

435
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,357
His Orcs have multiplied.

436
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:14,575
His fortress at Barad-dur is
rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

437
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,580
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

438
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:21,830
He is seeking it.

439
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:25,910
Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.

440
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,836
For the Ring yearns above all else...

441
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,467
to return to the hand of its master.

442
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,423
They are one...

443
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,723
the Ring and the Dark Lord.

444
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:38,966
Frodo...

445
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,393
he must never find it.

446
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:42,636
All right.

447
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:47,277
We put it away. We keep it
hidden. We never speak of it again.

448
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,157
No one knows it's here, do they?

449
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,024
Do they, Gandalf?

450
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:01,497
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.

451
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,746
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

452
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:08,085
But the enemy found him first.

453
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,297
I don't know how long they tortured him.

454
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:16,972
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

455
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:17,903
Shire!

456
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,143
Baggins!

457
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:23,144
Shire.

458
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:26,224
Baggins. But that would lead them here!

459
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,098
Who goes there?

460
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,062
Take it, Gandalf!

461
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:34,486
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

462
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,072
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

463
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:40,618
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

464
00:40:42,165 --> 00:40:44,371
I dare not take it.

465
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,164
Not even to keep it safe.

466
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:50,295
Understand, Frodo...

467
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:54,584
I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.

468
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:05,721
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

469
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:09,231
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

470
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:12,735
No, it can't.

471
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,449
What must I do?

472
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:24,656
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

473
00:41:24,874 --> 00:41:28,123
Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree.

474
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:29,497
Bree.

475
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:32,461
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

476
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:35,126
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

477
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,042
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

478
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,255
I don't have any answers.

479
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:48,305
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

480
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:50,643
He'll know what to do.

481
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:54,112
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.

482
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:56,811
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

483
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,774
Travel only by day. And stay off the road.

484
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,616
I can cut across country easily enough.

485
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:08,452
My dear Frodo.

486
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:11,750
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

487
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,878
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

488
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:17,414
And yet, after a hundred years...

489
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,673
they can still surprise you.

490
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,631
Get down.

491
00:42:34,857 --> 00:42:38,309
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

492
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:42,990
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

493
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,608
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

494
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:48,663
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

495
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:49,988
Nothing important.

496
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:54,620
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

497
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,583
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

498
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:01,051
No?

499
00:43:03,136 --> 00:43:04,250
Perhaps not.

500
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:08,928
I've thought of a better use for you.

501
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:13,686
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

502
00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:17,396
Be careful, both of you.

503
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:20,444
The enemy has many spies in his service:

504
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:23,613
Birds, beasts.

505
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:27,195
Is it safe?

506
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,247
Never put it on...

507
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:33,824
for the agents of the Dark
Lord will be drawn to its power.

508
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:35,536
Always remember, Frodo...

509
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:39,209
the Ring is trying to get back to its master.

510
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:41,710
It wants to be found.

511
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:24,503
This is it.

512
00:44:24,841 --> 00:44:26,964
This is what?

513
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:29,378
If I take one more step...

514
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,757
it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.

515
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:39,473
Come on, Sam.

516
00:44:47,948 --> 00:44:49,775
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

517
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:54,074
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

518
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:58,700
You step onto the road, and
if you don't keep your feet...

519
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:03,082
there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

520
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:17,933
Sam.

521
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,346
Wood-elves.

522
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:40,615
They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.

523
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,909
To the Grey Havens.

524
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,493
They're leaving Middle-earth.

525
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:47,918
Never to return.

526
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:52,918
I don't know why...

527
00:45:53,638 --> 00:45:56,010
it makes me sad.

528
00:45:58,058 --> 00:46:02,719
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

529
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:05,148
Just shut your eyes...

530
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,111
and imagine you're back in your own bed...

531
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,234
with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

532
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:24,209
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

533
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:27,288
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

534
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,003
Me neither, Sam.

535
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:03,531
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

536
00:47:03,748 --> 00:47:05,372
The hour grows late.

537
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:09,167
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

538
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,787
seeking my counsel.

539
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:15,956
For that is why you have come, is it not?

540
00:47:16,176 --> 00:47:17,456
My old friend.

541
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,338
Saruman.

542
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:27,143
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

543
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,221
So the Ring of Power has been found.

544
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:33,644
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

545
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:37,064
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

546
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:42,071
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

547
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:46,951
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

548
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:48,659
Time?

549
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:52,246
What time do you think we have?

550
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:56,503
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

551
00:47:56,717 --> 00:47:58,923
He cannot yet take physical form...

552
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,840
but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

553
00:48:02,514 --> 00:48:07,590
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

554
00:48:08,144 --> 00:48:14,100
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

555
00:48:15,612 --> 00:48:18,731
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

556
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:24,896
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

557
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,663
The Eye of Sauron.

558
00:48:27,873 --> 00:48:30,445
He is gathering all evil to him.

559
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,764
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

560
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,748
great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

561
00:48:36,088 --> 00:48:38,461
You know this?

562
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:40,501
How?

563
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:42,753
I have seen it.

564
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,383
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

565
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,594
Why?

566
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,763
Why should we fear to use it?

567
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:58,348
They are not all accounted
for, the lost Seeing-stones.

568
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,772
We do not know who else may be watching.

569
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:07,071
The hour is later than you think.

570
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,610
Sauron's forces are already moving.

571
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:14,625
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

572
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:16,034
The Nine?

573
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:19,255
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

574
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:22,135
disguised as riders in black.

575
00:49:22,343 --> 00:49:26,290
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

576
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:30,136
And kill the one who carries it.

577
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:32,136
Frodo!

578
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,154
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

579
00:49:49,913 --> 00:49:52,700
There are none who can.

580
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:57,911
Against the power of Mordor...

581
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,748
there can be no victory.

582
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:05,881
We must join with him, Gandalf.

583
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:09,503
We must join with Sauron.

584
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:14,851
It would be wise, my friend.

585
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,769
Tell me...

586
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:18,010
friend...

587
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:23,567
when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

588
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:04,774
I gave you the chance...

589
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:08,524
of aiding me willingly...

590
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:12,903
but you have elected the way of pain!

591
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:37,718
Mr. Frodo?

592
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:40,100
Frodo? Frodo!

593
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,724
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

594
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,941
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

595
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:52,645
"Don't you lose him, Samwise
Gamgee." And I don't mean to.

596
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:56,526
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

597
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:00,529
Frodo.

598
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,030
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

599
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:04,624
Get off him.

600
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,585
Come on, Frodo.

601
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,668
What's the meaning of this?

602
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:12,215
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

603
00:52:13,384 --> 00:52:15,509
You get back here!

604
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:17,793
Get out of my field!

605
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:20,849
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

606
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,976
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

607
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:25,267
And some cabbages.

608
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:28,400
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

609
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:32,654
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

610
00:52:32,863 --> 00:52:35,020
he's clearly overreacting.

611
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,733
Run!

612
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:52,751
Oh, that was close.

613
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:56,962
I think I've broken something.

614
00:52:57,972 --> 00:53:00,297
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

615
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:04,133
What? That was just a detour. A short cut.

616
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:06,592
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

617
00:53:15,363 --> 00:53:16,857
That's mine.

618
00:53:19,618 --> 00:53:21,241
That's nice, Merry.

619
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:23,778
Here's a nice one, Sam.

620
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,534
I think we should get off the road.

621
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,091
Get off the road!

622
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,794
Quick!

623
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,976
Be quiet!

624
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,456
What was that?

625
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:35,661
Anything?

626
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,830
Nothing.

627
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,835
What is going on?

628
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:45,164
That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.

629
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,004
Frodo?

630
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,710
Get down!

631
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,864
I have to leave the Shire.

632
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:12,158
Sam and I must get to Bree.

633
00:56:12,371 --> 00:56:13,830
Right.

634
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,446
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

635
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,087
Run!

636
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,295
This way! Follow me!

637
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:34,922
Run!

638
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,981
Get the rope, Sam!

639
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,161
Frodo!

640
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,281
Run, Frodo!

641
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,702
- Go!
-Hurry!

642
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,537
Frodo, come on!

643
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,499
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

644
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:22,645
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

645
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,739
Come on.

646
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:53,374
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

647
00:57:56,846 --> 00:57:59,682
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

648
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:03,842
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

649
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,439
We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own.

650
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,100
All right, young sir. I meant no offense.

651
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,812
It's my job to ask questions after night fall.

652
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,868
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

653
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,235
Can't be too careful.

654
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,430
Out of the way! Watch where you're walking.

655
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,082
Excuse me.

656
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:11,879
Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you?

657
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:18,175
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

658
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:23,048
Always proud to cater to the Little Folk, Mister...?

659
00:59:24,142 --> 00:59:26,180
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

660
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:29,927
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

661
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:33,315
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

662
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,479
Gandalf.

663
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:37,988
Oh, yes...

664
00:59:38,198 --> 00:59:40,273
I remember. Elderly chap.

665
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:43,571
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

666
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:45,780
Not seen him for six months.

667
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:53,868
What do we do now?

668
01:00:01,093 --> 01:00:02,291
Sam...

669
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,387
he'll be here. He'll come.

670
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:09,219
Get out of my way!

671
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:13,265
What's that?

672
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:15,974
This, my friend, is a pint.

673
01:00:16,194 --> 01:00:17,818
It comes in pints?

674
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:21,897
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

675
01:00:28,246 --> 01:00:32,077
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

676
01:00:35,628 --> 01:00:37,123
Excuse me.

677
01:00:38,924 --> 01:00:41,925
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

678
01:00:43,094 --> 01:00:47,472
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

679
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:52,262
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

680
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,847
Strider.

681
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:09,752
Baggins.

682
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:17,126
Baggins.

683
01:01:29,474 --> 01:01:31,714
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

684
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:35,351
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

685
01:01:35,561 --> 01:01:38,598
He's my second cousin, once
removed on his mother's side...

686
01:01:38,815 --> 01:01:41,059
and my third cousin, twice removed...

687
01:01:45,573 --> 01:01:47,364
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

688
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:19,350
You cannot hide.

689
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,436
I see you.

690
01:02:27,156 --> 01:02:29,826
There is no life...

691
01:02:30,035 --> 01:02:32,192
in the void.

692
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:33,905
Only...

693
01:02:34,828 --> 01:02:36,323
death.

694
01:02:42,336 --> 01:02:47,213
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

695
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:52,876
What do you want?

696
01:02:53,096 --> 01:02:55,136
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

697
01:02:55,557 --> 01:02:58,559
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

698
01:02:58,853 --> 01:03:01,346
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

699
01:03:01,566 --> 01:03:05,265
but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

700
01:03:05,777 --> 01:03:08,397
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

701
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:10,602
Yes.

702
01:03:10,822 --> 01:03:14,737
Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.

703
01:03:18,748 --> 01:03:21,285
Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

704
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:27,040
You have a stout heart, little
Hobbit. But that will not save you.

705
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:30,174
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

706
01:03:30,384 --> 01:03:31,465
They're coming.

707
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,544
What are they?

708
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,843
They were once Men.

709
01:05:01,056 --> 01:05:03,261
Great kings of Men.

710
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,935
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave
to them nine rings of power.

711
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:10,642
Blinded by their greed, they
took them without question.

712
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:14,143
One by one, falling into darkness.

713
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:16,851
Now they are slaves to his will.

714
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,949
They are the Nazgul.

715
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:23,864
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

716
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:26,032
At all times they feel...

717
01:05:26,248 --> 01:05:28,156
the presence of the Ring...

718
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:32,918
drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

719
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:45,842
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

720
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:58,070
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?

721
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:01,115
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

722
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:05,405
- and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

723
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,832
We have no choice but to trust him.

724
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:12,457
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

725
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:18,122
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

726
01:06:18,715 --> 01:06:21,465
We're going to see the Elves.

727
01:06:43,117 --> 01:06:47,326
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

728
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,204
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

729
01:06:50,413 --> 01:06:52,618
What about second breakfast?

730
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:59,211
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

731
01:06:59,422 --> 01:07:04,629
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

732
01:07:04,844 --> 01:07:09,007
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

733
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:16,105
Pippin!

734
01:07:32,622 --> 01:07:36,073
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

735
01:08:14,915 --> 01:08:17,121
Who is she?

736
01:08:17,834 --> 01:08:20,407
This woman you sing of.

737
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:26,209
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

738
01:08:26,423 --> 01:08:31,585
The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.

739
01:08:33,431 --> 01:08:35,554
What happened to her?

740
01:08:37,768 --> 01:08:40,260
She died.

741
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:46,644
Get some sleep, Frodo.

742
01:08:56,912 --> 01:09:00,991
The power of Isengard is at your command...

743
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:05,621
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

744
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:14,755
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

745
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:24,814
What orders from Mordor, my
lord? What does the Eye command?

746
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:27,183
We have work to do.

747
01:10:09,776 --> 01:10:14,438
The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep.

748
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:16,654
Rip them all down.

749
01:10:44,059 --> 01:10:46,977
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sul.

750
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:51,310
We shall rest here tonight.

751
01:11:02,994 --> 01:11:06,444
These are for you. Keep them close.

752
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:09,157
I'm going to have a look around.

753
01:11:11,503 --> 01:11:13,412
Stay here.

754
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:18,124
My tomato's burst.

755
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:20,252
Could I have some bacon?

756
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,427
Want a tomato, Sam?

757
01:11:22,805 --> 01:11:26,473
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

758
01:11:26,686 --> 01:11:29,356
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

759
01:11:29,564 --> 01:11:33,560
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

760
01:11:42,034 --> 01:11:42,784
Go!

761
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:38,664
Back, you devils!

762
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,370
Frodo!

763
01:14:08,136 --> 01:14:09,334
Oh, Sam.

764
01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:47,368
Strider!

765
01:14:50,134 --> 01:14:55,639
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

766
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:02,011
This is beyond my skill to
heal. He needs Elvish medicine.

767
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:07,642
Hurry!

768
01:15:07,862 --> 01:15:11,811
We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!

769
01:15:12,032 --> 01:15:13,906
Hold on, Frodo.

770
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,484
Gandalf!

771
01:17:54,524 --> 01:17:57,560
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

772
01:17:59,737 --> 01:18:02,608
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

773
01:18:05,495 --> 01:18:07,237
Is he going to die?

774
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:12,329
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

775
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:21,290
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

776
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,969
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

777
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:24,209
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

778
01:18:24,429 --> 01:18:27,630
It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry!

779
01:18:41,987 --> 01:18:46,151
What's this? A Ranger caught off his guard?

780
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:12,048
Frodo.

781
01:19:14,019 --> 01:19:17,139
I am Arwen... I've come to help you.

782
01:19:19,566 --> 01:19:21,394
Hear my voice...

783
01:19:21,653 --> 01:19:23,776
Come back to the light.

784
01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:30,739
Who is she?

785
01:19:31,368 --> 01:19:33,159
Frodo.

786
01:19:33,453 --> 01:19:36,954
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

787
01:19:39,251 --> 01:19:41,411
He's not going to last.

788
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:44,298
We must get him to my father.

789
01:19:45,007 --> 01:19:47,878
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

790
01:19:48,094 --> 01:19:54,217
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

791
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,719
Stay with the Hobbits... I'll send horses for you.

792
01:19:57,939 --> 01:19:59,597
I'm the faster rider... I'll take him.

793
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:01,814
The Road is too dangerous.

794
01:20:02,023 --> 01:20:03,186
What are they saying?

795
01:20:03,483 --> 01:20:05,522
If I can get across the river...

796
01:20:05,735 --> 01:20:08,310
the power of my people will protect him.

797
01:20:09,323 --> 01:20:10,900
I do not fear them.

798
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:22,168
Arwen...

799
01:20:22,377 --> 01:20:25,582
ride hard. Don't look back.

800
01:20:30,636 --> 01:20:34,963
What are you doing?! Those Wraiths are still out there!

801
01:22:29,627 --> 01:22:32,334
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

802
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,837
If you want him, come and claim him.

803
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:30,569
No. No!

804
01:23:35,527 --> 01:23:37,769
Frodo, no.

805
01:23:37,988 --> 01:23:40,276
Frodo, don't give in.

806
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:42,481
Not now.

807
01:23:53,418 --> 01:23:55,909
What grace is given me...

808
01:23:56,588 --> 01:23:58,414
let it pass to him.

809
01:23:58,631 --> 01:24:00,790
Let him be spared.

810
01:24:01,426 --> 01:24:03,465
Save him.

811
01:24:15,898 --> 01:24:21,060
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

812
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:27,989
And it is 10:00 in the morning on
October 24th, if you want to know.

813
01:24:29,954 --> 01:24:33,703
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

814
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:38,455
And you're lucky to be here too.

815
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:43,128
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

816
01:24:43,343 --> 01:24:47,469
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

817
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:57,596
What happened, Gandalf?

818
01:24:58,525 --> 01:25:03,946
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

819
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,404
I was delayed.

820
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:15,498
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.

821
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:24,338
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

822
01:25:24,675 --> 01:25:27,379
Embrace the power of the Ring...

823
01:25:27,969 --> 01:25:30,507
or embrace your own destruction!

824
01:25:32,808 --> 01:25:36,676
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

825
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,894
Only one who can bend it to his will.

826
01:25:41,776 --> 01:25:45,690
And he does not share power.

827
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:03,376
So you have chosen death.

828
01:26:13,474 --> 01:26:17,258
Gandalf? What is it?

829
01:26:18,228 --> 01:26:20,018
Nothing, Frodo.

830
01:26:20,687 --> 01:26:22,597
Frodo!

831
01:26:23,982 --> 01:26:26,354
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

832
01:26:26,568 --> 01:26:29,320
Sam has hardly left your side.

833
01:26:29,531 --> 01:26:31,689
We were that worried about
you. Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

834
01:26:32,074 --> 01:26:37,198
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.

835
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:42,288
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

836
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,632
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

837
01:27:33,843 --> 01:27:35,552
Bilbo.

838
01:27:40,434 --> 01:27:42,308
"There and Back Again:

839
01:27:42,519 --> 01:27:45,305
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

840
01:27:48,402 --> 01:27:51,935
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

841
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:56,061
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

842
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:58,814
visit Lake-town...

843
01:27:59,033 --> 01:28:02,451
see the Lonely Mountain again.

844
01:28:02,872 --> 01:28:07,783
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

845
01:28:19,932 --> 01:28:21,676
I miss the Shire.

846
01:28:22,101 --> 01:28:27,258
I spent all my childhood
pretending I was off somewhere else.

847
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,138
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

848
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:37,687
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.

849
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:46,114
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

850
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,531
My dear boy.

851
01:28:53,673 --> 01:28:57,621
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

852
01:28:58,425 --> 01:29:00,217
No harm in being prepared.

853
01:29:00,427 --> 01:29:02,964
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

854
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,052
- More than anything.
- I did.

855
01:29:06,268 --> 01:29:08,177
It's just...

856
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:11,552
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

857
01:29:11,773 --> 01:29:15,438
We got the Ring this far, to
Rivendell. And I thought...

858
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:18,937
seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.

859
01:29:19,155 --> 01:29:20,862
Off home.

860
01:29:25,037 --> 01:29:27,029
You are right, Sam.

861
01:29:29,207 --> 01:29:31,957
We did what we set out to do.

862
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:35,079
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

863
01:29:39,217 --> 01:29:41,541
I am ready to go home.

864
01:29:42,303 --> 01:29:44,342
His strength returns.

865
01:29:44,554 --> 01:29:50,261
That wound will never fully heal. He
will carry it the rest of his life.

866
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:53,345
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...

867
01:29:53,565 --> 01:29:57,266
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

868
01:29:57,486 --> 01:30:00,854
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

869
01:30:01,071 --> 01:30:06,490
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

870
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:11,364
Sauron's forces are massing in the
East. His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

871
01:30:11,582 --> 01:30:14,334
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

872
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:17,745
Our list of allies grows thin.

873
01:30:18,505 --> 01:30:21,292
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

874
01:30:21,508 --> 01:30:25,126
By foul craft, Saruman has
crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

875
01:30:25,345 --> 01:30:27,803
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

876
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:32,677
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

877
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,266
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

878
01:30:35,688 --> 01:30:39,767
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

879
01:30:39,983 --> 01:30:44,362
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

880
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,273
Gandalf...

881
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:53,158
the Ring cannot stay here.

882
01:31:12,684 --> 01:31:15,934
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

883
01:31:16,145 --> 01:31:18,850
They must decide now how to end it.

884
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:23,476
The time of the Elves is over. My
people are leaving these shores.

885
01:31:24,153 --> 01:31:27,735
Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves?

886
01:31:27,947 --> 01:31:33,026
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

887
01:31:34,664 --> 01:31:37,498
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

888
01:31:37,832 --> 01:31:39,540
Men?

889
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:43,620
Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.

890
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:48,251
The blood of Numenor is all but
spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.

891
01:31:48,635 --> 01:31:52,087
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

892
01:31:52,305 --> 01:31:53,930
I was there, Gandalf.

893
01:31:54,599 --> 01:31:57,435
I was there 3000 years ago...

894
01:32:04,235 --> 01:32:06,642
when Isildur took the Ring.

895
01:32:06,862 --> 01:32:10,728
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.

896
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:15,858
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

897
01:32:17,456 --> 01:32:21,074
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

898
01:32:21,292 --> 01:32:24,827
where the Ring was forged, the
one place it could be destroyed.

899
01:32:25,046 --> 01:32:27,619
Cast it into the fire!

900
01:32:32,763 --> 01:32:36,595
- Destroy it!
- No.

901
01:32:37,935 --> 01:32:40,092
Isildur!

902
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:45,268
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

903
01:32:49,404 --> 01:32:53,650
Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken.

904
01:32:54,575 --> 01:32:58,193
There's no strength left in the world of Men.

905
01:32:58,411 --> 01:33:03,240
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

906
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:06,793
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

907
01:33:08,548 --> 01:33:12,295
He turned from that path a long time ago.

908
01:33:12,508 --> 01:33:14,631
He has chosen exile.

909
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:47,657
You are no Elf.

910
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,952
Men of the South are welcome here.

911
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:54,129
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

912
01:33:55,593 --> 01:33:58,380
Then we are here on common purpose...

913
01:33:58,806 --> 01:34:00,216
friend.

914
01:34:15,446 --> 01:34:18,362
The shards of Narsil.

915
01:34:21,867 --> 01:34:26,329
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.

916
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:31,451
It's still sharp.

917
01:34:40,389 --> 01:34:43,425
But no more than a broken heirloom.

918
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:13,287
Why do you fear the past?

919
01:35:14,171 --> 01:35:19,543
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.

920
01:35:19,758 --> 01:35:23,174
You are not bound to his fate.

921
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,672
The same blood flows in my veins.

922
01:35:30,729 --> 01:35:33,267
The same weakness.

923
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:38,735
Your time will come.

924
01:35:38,944 --> 01:35:43,360
You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it.

925
01:35:46,578 --> 01:35:48,986
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

926
01:35:49,997 --> 01:35:53,578
Not over you... not over me.

927
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:08,173
Do you remember when we first met?

928
01:36:11,726 --> 01:36:16,272
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

929
01:36:16,817 --> 01:36:19,307
Long years have passed.

930
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:24,396
You did not have the cares you carry now.

931
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:27,904
Do you remember what I told you?

932
01:36:33,874 --> 01:36:36,579
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

933
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:43,585
forsaking the immortal life of your people.

934
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:46,635
And to that I hold.

935
01:36:46,846 --> 01:36:50,464
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

936
01:36:50,683 --> 01:36:54,513
than face all the Ages of this world alone.

937
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:06,771
I choose a mortal life.

938
01:37:08,116 --> 01:37:12,363
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

939
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:18,120
like my heart.

940
01:37:33,934 --> 01:37:37,598
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

941
01:37:37,812 --> 01:37:41,761
you've been summoned here to
answer the threat of Mordor.

942
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:47,275
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

943
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:51,024
You will unite, or you will fall.

944
01:37:51,243 --> 01:37:55,489
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

945
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,870
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

946
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,639
So it is true.

947
01:38:34,115 --> 01:38:36,194
In a dream...

948
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:41,032
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

949
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,040
but in the West a pale light lingered.

950
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,625
A voice was crying:

951
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,795
"Your doom is near at hand.

952
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:52,551
Isildur's Bane is found."

953
01:38:56,599 --> 01:38:58,390
Isildur's Bane.

954
01:38:58,976 --> 01:39:00,255
Boromir!

955
01:39:23,417 --> 01:39:27,417
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

956
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:31,300
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

957
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,461
for the Black Speech of Mordor...

958
01:39:33,716 --> 01:39:35,090
may yet be heard...

959
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:38,219
in every corner of the West!

960
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:41,135
The Ring is altogether evil.

961
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:42,975
It is a gift.

962
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,637
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

963
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:48,352
Why not use this Ring?

964
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:51,317
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

965
01:39:51,526 --> 01:39:55,857
kept the forces of Mordor at
bay. By the blood of our people...

966
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:58,357
are your lands kept safe.

967
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:04,494
Give Gondor the weapon of the
enemy. Let us use it against him.

968
01:40:04,705 --> 01:40:08,452
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

969
01:40:09,042 --> 01:40:13,123
The One Ring answers to Sauron
alone. It has no other master.

970
01:40:13,339 --> 01:40:16,874
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?

971
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:19,170
This is no mere Ranger.

972
01:40:20,138 --> 01:40:23,803
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

973
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:27,227
You owe him your allegiance.

974
01:40:31,316 --> 01:40:33,226
Aragorn.

975
01:40:35,027 --> 01:40:37,813
This is Isildur's heir?

976
01:40:40,156 --> 01:40:42,910
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

977
01:40:45,037 --> 01:40:46,495
Sit down, Legolas.

978
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:52,626
Gondor has no king.

979
01:40:54,504 --> 01:40:56,212
Gondor needs no king.

980
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:06,553
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

981
01:41:07,559 --> 01:41:11,057
You have only one choice.

982
01:41:11,269 --> 01:41:13,596
The Ring must be destroyed.

983
01:41:18,862 --> 01:41:21,436
What are we waiting for?

984
01:41:33,544 --> 01:41:36,580
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

985
01:41:36,797 --> 01:41:41,006
by any craft that we here possess.

986
01:41:41,549 --> 01:41:45,678
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

987
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:49,720
Only there can it be unmade.

988
01:41:50,811 --> 01:41:53,384
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

989
01:41:53,605 --> 01:41:58,562
and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.

990
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:02,563
One of you...

991
01:42:03,073 --> 01:42:05,232
must do this.

992
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:11,860
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

993
01:42:12,788 --> 01:42:16,407
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.

994
01:42:17,251 --> 01:42:21,380
There is evil there that does not sleep.

995
01:42:21,589 --> 01:42:25,838
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

996
01:42:26,595 --> 01:42:28,635
It is a barren wasteland...

997
01:42:28,848 --> 01:42:32,430
riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

998
01:42:32,643 --> 01:42:36,476
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

999
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:40,983
Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly.

1000
01:42:41,193 --> 01:42:45,652
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1001
01:42:45,862 --> 01:42:48,437
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1002
01:42:48,658 --> 01:42:53,320
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1003
01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:58,780
I will be dead before I see
the Ring in the hands of an Elf!

1004
01:43:00,795 --> 01:43:03,286
Never trust an Elf!

1005
01:43:04,465 --> 01:43:10,304
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1006
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:13,509
None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!

1007
01:43:32,285 --> 01:43:34,526
I will take it.

1008
01:43:36,496 --> 01:43:39,036
I will take it.

1009
01:43:44,838 --> 01:43:47,921
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1010
01:43:56,016 --> 01:43:57,263
Though...

1011
01:44:00,396 --> 01:44:02,187
I do not know the way.

1012
01:44:04,233 --> 01:44:08,528
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1013
01:44:08,738 --> 01:44:12,107
as long as it is yours to bear.

1014
01:44:13,243 --> 01:44:16,277
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1015
01:44:17,036 --> 01:44:18,364
I will.

1016
01:44:21,623 --> 01:44:23,912
You have my sword.

1017
01:44:25,712 --> 01:44:27,787
And you have my bow.

1018
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,872
And my axe.

1019
01:44:37,891 --> 01:44:40,893
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1020
01:44:42,897 --> 01:44:46,562
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1021
01:44:47,026 --> 01:44:49,479
then Gondor will see it done.

1022
01:44:52,071 --> 01:44:56,817
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1023
01:44:57,035 --> 01:45:01,911
even when he is summoned to a
secret Council and you are not.

1024
01:45:02,499 --> 01:45:04,407
We're coming too!

1025
01:45:06,418 --> 01:45:09,206
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1026
01:45:09,421 --> 01:45:12,791
Anyway, you need people of
intelligence on this sort of...

1027
01:45:13,134 --> 01:45:14,416
mission.

1028
01:45:14,637 --> 01:45:16,096
Quest.

1029
01:45:16,556 --> 01:45:17,587
Thing.

1030
01:45:19,474 --> 01:45:22,177
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1031
01:45:23,727 --> 01:45:25,635
Nine companions.

1032
01:45:27,438 --> 01:45:29,267
So be it.

1033
01:45:29,608 --> 01:45:32,646
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

1034
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:35,106
Great!

1035
01:45:35,364 --> 01:45:37,605
Where are we going?

1036
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,640
She wanted to protect her child...

1037
01:46:17,482 --> 01:46:21,266
she thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

1038
01:46:23,445 --> 01:46:26,945
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1039
01:46:27,408 --> 01:46:29,116
That you'd never escape your fate.

1040
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:33,278
The skill of the Elves can
reforge the sword of kings...

1041
01:46:33,707 --> 01:46:37,620
but only you have the power to wield it.

1042
01:46:38,668 --> 01:46:41,079
I do not want that power.

1043
01:46:41,298 --> 01:46:44,003
I have never wanted it.

1044
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:47,875
You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other.

1045
01:46:52,434 --> 01:46:54,759
My old sword! Sting.

1046
01:46:54,977 --> 01:46:56,140
Here, take it. Take it.

1047
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:05,520
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1048
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:10,404
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.

1049
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:15,198
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1050
01:47:15,415 --> 01:47:17,872
Here's a pretty thing.

1051
01:47:18,294 --> 01:47:19,574
Mithril.

1052
01:47:20,378 --> 01:47:24,756
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

1053
01:47:24,966 --> 01:47:28,217
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1054
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:38,309
My old ring.

1055
01:47:39,566 --> 01:47:43,480
I should very much like...

1056
01:47:43,694 --> 01:47:47,738
to hold it again, one last time.

1057
01:48:05,092 --> 01:48:08,756
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1058
01:48:09,096 --> 01:48:13,175
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1059
01:48:17,689 --> 01:48:20,773
I'm sorry for everything.

1060
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:39,957
The Ring-bearer is setting
out on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1061
01:48:41,295 --> 01:48:43,916
On you who travel with him, no oath...

1062
01:48:44,132 --> 01:48:47,253
nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1063
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,219
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1064
01:48:53,683 --> 01:48:57,597
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1065
01:48:58,146 --> 01:49:00,767
and all Free Folk go with you.

1066
01:49:03,818 --> 01:49:07,949
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1067
01:49:26,341 --> 01:49:28,831
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1068
01:49:29,385 --> 01:49:31,215
Left.

1069
01:50:50,846 --> 01:50:55,258
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1070
01:50:55,475 --> 01:50:59,224
If our luck holds, the Gap of
Rohan will still be open to us.

1071
01:50:59,436 --> 01:51:02,971
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1072
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:07,022
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1073
01:51:08,822 --> 01:51:09,854
Move your feet.

1074
01:51:10,073 --> 01:51:11,402
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1075
01:51:11,617 --> 01:51:13,029
Faster!

1076
01:51:14,369 --> 01:51:18,152
If anyone was to ask for my
opinion, which I note they're not...

1077
01:51:18,373 --> 01:51:21,127
I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1078
01:51:21,627 --> 01:51:24,711
Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.

1079
01:51:25,337 --> 01:51:29,206
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1080
01:51:29,425 --> 01:51:34,767
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1081
01:51:44,026 --> 01:51:45,187
Sorry!

1082
01:51:45,901 --> 01:51:47,395
Get him!

1083
01:51:48,862 --> 01:51:51,318
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1084
01:51:51,865 --> 01:51:54,237
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1085
01:51:57,999 --> 01:51:59,623
You've got my arm! You've got my arm!

1086
01:52:00,084 --> 01:52:02,705
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1087
01:52:02,919 --> 01:52:05,624
It's moving fast.

1088
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,040
Against the wind.

1089
01:52:08,801 --> 01:52:10,922
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1090
01:52:11,136 --> 01:52:13,888
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1091
01:52:47,299 --> 01:52:49,008
Spies of Saruman.

1092
01:52:49,801 --> 01:52:53,051
The passage south is being watched.

1093
01:52:54,181 --> 01:52:57,514
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1094
01:53:10,154 --> 01:53:11,863
Frodo!

1095
01:53:30,842 --> 01:53:33,130
Boromir.

1096
01:53:33,345 --> 01:53:37,557
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1097
01:53:37,768 --> 01:53:40,887
over so small a thing.

1098
01:53:44,106 --> 01:53:46,064
Such a little thing.

1099
01:53:46,275 --> 01:53:47,734
Boromir!

1100
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:51,030
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1101
01:54:00,874 --> 01:54:02,914
As you wish.

1102
01:54:03,627 --> 01:54:05,666
I care not.

1103
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:45,749
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1104
01:54:45,961 --> 01:54:50,541
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1105
01:54:51,842 --> 01:54:54,797
If the mountain defeats you...

1106
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:59,473
will you risk a more dangerous road?

1107
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:14,740
There is a fell voice on the air.

1108
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:17,320
It's Saruman!

1109
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:30,915
He's trying to bring down the
mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back!

1110
01:55:31,133 --> 01:55:32,133
No!

1111
01:56:39,411 --> 01:56:41,237
We must get off the mountain!

1112
01:56:41,706 --> 01:56:46,034
Make for the Gap of Rohan, and
take the west road to my city!

1113
01:56:46,251 --> 01:56:49,620
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1114
01:56:49,838 --> 01:56:53,540
We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it.

1115
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,594
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1116
01:56:58,432 --> 01:57:02,263
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1117
01:57:02,936 --> 01:57:07,977
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1118
01:57:08,775 --> 01:57:13,651
You know what they awoke in
the darkness of Khazad-dum:

1119
01:57:14,947 --> 01:57:18,448
Shadow and flame.

1120
01:57:21,789 --> 01:57:24,541
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1121
01:57:29,214 --> 01:57:31,335
We cannot stay here!

1122
01:57:31,548 --> 01:57:34,300
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1123
01:57:34,509 --> 01:57:36,169
Frodo?

1124
01:57:39,222 --> 01:57:42,095
We will go through the mines.

1125
01:57:42,894 --> 01:57:44,804
So be it.

1126
01:57:51,402 --> 01:57:55,270
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1127
01:57:58,826 --> 01:58:01,032
How is your shoulder?

1128
01:58:01,245 --> 01:58:04,496
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1129
01:58:06,085 --> 01:58:08,575
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1130
01:58:09,045 --> 01:58:11,963
I've felt it too. You must be careful now.

1131
01:58:12,425 --> 01:58:16,256
Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.

1132
01:58:16,469 --> 01:58:19,043
And, I fear, from within.

1133
01:58:21,683 --> 01:58:25,811
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1134
01:58:26,022 --> 01:58:28,855
Trust your own strengths.

1135
01:58:29,065 --> 01:58:31,604
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1136
01:58:31,819 --> 01:58:33,859
for good or for evil.

1137
01:58:34,072 --> 01:58:36,360
Some are greater than I am.

1138
01:58:36,908 --> 01:58:40,525
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1139
01:58:41,955 --> 01:58:43,282
The walls...

1140
01:58:43,998 --> 01:58:46,074
of Moria.

1141
01:58:51,797 --> 01:58:54,799
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1142
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:59,470
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot
find them if their secrets are forgotten.

1143
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:02,261
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1144
01:59:10,274 --> 01:59:13,608
Well, let's see.

1145
01:59:13,862 --> 01:59:15,236
Ithildin.

1146
01:59:15,862 --> 01:59:19,234
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1147
01:59:33,298 --> 01:59:37,377
It reads, "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1148
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:42,595
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1149
01:59:42,809 --> 01:59:47,554
It's simple. If you are a friend, you
speak the password and the doors will open.

1150
02:00:11,338 --> 02:00:12,452
Nothing's happening.

1151
02:00:19,471 --> 02:00:23,717
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves...

1152
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:26,762
Men and Orcs.

1153
02:00:27,061 --> 02:00:28,259
What are you going to do, then?

1154
02:00:28,521 --> 02:00:30,728
Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!

1155
02:00:30,983 --> 02:00:32,941
And if that does not shatter them...

1156
02:00:33,152 --> 02:00:35,821
and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

1157
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:39,481
I will try to find the opening words.

1158
02:00:52,337 --> 02:00:54,875
Mines are no place for a pony.

1159
02:00:55,173 --> 02:00:59,254
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1160
02:01:00,431 --> 02:01:03,217
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1161
02:01:03,766 --> 02:01:07,301
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1162
02:01:14,109 --> 02:01:16,683
Do not disturb the water.

1163
02:01:16,905 --> 02:01:18,778
Oh, it's useless.

1164
02:01:31,462 --> 02:01:33,619
It's a riddle.

1165
02:01:36,382 --> 02:01:39,502
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1166
02:01:39,887 --> 02:01:42,803
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1167
02:01:44,224 --> 02:01:45,506
Mellon.

1168
02:02:03,577 --> 02:02:08,453
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the
fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1169
02:02:08,916 --> 02:02:14,623
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1170
02:02:16,133 --> 02:02:19,217
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1171
02:02:19,553 --> 02:02:21,960
And they call it a mine.

1172
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,137
A mine!

1173
02:02:25,183 --> 02:02:28,518
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1174
02:02:34,652 --> 02:02:36,230
No...

1175
02:02:37,488 --> 02:02:38,238
No!

1176
02:02:41,783 --> 02:02:43,326
Goblins.

1177
02:02:47,247 --> 02:02:51,542
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1178
02:02:52,585 --> 02:02:55,160
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1179
02:02:57,966 --> 02:03:00,340
- Frodo!
- Help!

1180
02:03:00,555 --> 02:03:02,130
Strider!

1181
02:03:02,346 --> 02:03:05,099
- Help!
- Get off him!

1182
02:03:05,309 --> 02:03:06,340
Aragorn!

1183
02:03:16,777 --> 02:03:17,808
Frodo!

1184
02:03:44,139 --> 02:03:45,169
Into the mines!

1185
02:03:45,389 --> 02:03:48,594
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1186
02:03:52,899 --> 02:03:54,641
Run!

1187
02:04:11,542 --> 02:04:15,126
We now have but one choice.

1188
02:04:15,339 --> 02:04:20,214
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1189
02:04:20,468 --> 02:04:22,426
Be on your guard.

1190
02:04:22,637 --> 02:04:26,053
There are older and fouler things than Orcs...

1191
02:04:26,266 --> 02:04:29,801
in the deep places of the world.

1192
02:04:37,779 --> 02:04:41,693
Quietly now. It's a four-day
journey to the other side.

1193
02:04:41,908 --> 02:04:45,739
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1194
02:05:31,542 --> 02:05:35,207
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1195
02:05:35,421 --> 02:05:37,792
or jewels...

1196
02:05:38,006 --> 02:05:41,043
but mithril.

1197
02:05:59,403 --> 02:06:04,279
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril
rings that Thorin gave him.

1198
02:06:04,533 --> 02:06:08,448
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1199
02:06:08,662 --> 02:06:10,535
I never told him...

1200
02:06:10,748 --> 02:06:15,707
but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.

1201
02:06:28,058 --> 02:06:29,765
Pippin.

1202
02:06:50,122 --> 02:06:53,077
I have no memory of this place.

1203
02:06:55,127 --> 02:06:56,537
- Are we lost?
- No.

1204
02:06:56,753 --> 02:06:59,291
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1205
02:06:59,506 --> 02:07:00,965
- Merry?
- What?

1206
02:07:01,174 --> 02:07:03,084
I'm hungry.

1207
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:18,899
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1208
02:07:19,110 --> 02:07:23,239
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1209
02:07:23,448 --> 02:07:27,609
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
- Escaped...

1210
02:07:28,329 --> 02:07:29,953
or was set loose.

1211
02:07:30,498 --> 02:07:34,116
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1212
02:07:36,753 --> 02:07:39,505
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1213
02:07:39,715 --> 02:07:45,385
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1214
02:07:45,595 --> 02:07:50,422
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1215
02:07:50,641 --> 02:07:56,598
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1216
02:07:57,566 --> 02:08:00,354
Before it drove him mad.

1217
02:08:00,612 --> 02:08:03,481
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill
him when he had the chance.

1218
02:08:03,697 --> 02:08:04,896
Pity?

1219
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:08,903
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1220
02:08:09,787 --> 02:08:14,994
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1221
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:18,916
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1222
02:08:21,342 --> 02:08:25,290
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.

1223
02:08:25,512 --> 02:08:28,430
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1224
02:08:29,015 --> 02:08:34,933
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1225
02:08:35,731 --> 02:08:38,600
before this is over.

1226
02:08:40,108 --> 02:08:43,943
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1227
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:53,954
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1228
02:08:55,375 --> 02:08:57,415
I wish none of this had happened.

1229
02:08:57,628 --> 02:09:02,669
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1230
02:09:03,466 --> 02:09:08,972
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1231
02:09:10,474 --> 02:09:14,473
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1232
02:09:15,414 --> 02:09:17,309
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1233
02:09:17,818 --> 02:09:21,784
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1234
02:09:22,469 --> 02:09:24,378
And that is an encouraging thought.

1235
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:31,770
It's that way.

1236
02:09:32,498 --> 02:09:34,787
- He's remembered.
- No.

1237
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,784
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1238
02:09:39,005 --> 02:09:44,211
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1239
02:09:59,025 --> 02:10:03,187
Let me risk a little more light.

1240
02:10:07,824 --> 02:10:08,544
Behold...

1241
02:10:10,328 --> 02:10:15,569
the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1242
02:10:18,043 --> 02:10:21,461
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1243
02:10:46,407 --> 02:10:48,115
Gimli!

1244
02:10:55,542 --> 02:10:57,165
No!

1245
02:10:59,753 --> 02:11:00,714
Oh, no.

1246
02:11:04,757 --> 02:11:06,002
No.

1247
02:11:13,309 --> 02:11:15,300
"Here lies Balin...

1248
02:11:15,769 --> 02:11:17,763
son of Fundin...

1249
02:11:18,064 --> 02:11:20,684
Lord of Moria."

1250
02:11:21,776 --> 02:11:23,435
He is dead, then.

1251
02:11:25,154 --> 02:11:26,862
It's as I feared.

1252
02:11:45,091 --> 02:11:48,010
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1253
02:11:48,219 --> 02:11:52,928
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1254
02:11:54,018 --> 02:11:56,589
We have barred the gates...

1255
02:11:57,272 --> 02:11:59,727
but cannot hold them for long.

1256
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:02,776
The ground shakes.

1257
02:12:03,195 --> 02:12:04,772
Drums...

1258
02:12:05,155 --> 02:12:08,523
drums in the deep.

1259
02:12:12,076 --> 02:12:14,117
We cannot get out.

1260
02:12:16,123 --> 02:12:19,955
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1261
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:24,204
We cannot get out.

1262
02:12:27,219 --> 02:12:29,127
They are coming."

1263
02:13:12,182 --> 02:13:14,008
Fool of a Took!

1264
02:13:14,392 --> 02:13:18,175
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity!

1265
02:13:44,215 --> 02:13:45,923
Frodo!

1266
02:13:48,218 --> 02:13:49,677
Orcs!

1267
02:13:56,684 --> 02:13:58,677
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1268
02:14:05,903 --> 02:14:07,730
They have a cave-troll.

1269
02:14:23,545 --> 02:14:24,710
Let them come!

1270
02:14:25,215 --> 02:14:28,750
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.

1271
02:16:47,651 --> 02:16:50,403
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1272
02:16:55,119 --> 02:16:56,862
Frodo!

1273
02:17:30,404 --> 02:17:32,278
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1274
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:35,156
Frodo!

1275
02:18:20,331 --> 02:18:22,203
Frodo!

1276
02:19:22,438 --> 02:19:23,717
Oh, no!

1277
02:19:32,113 --> 02:19:34,022
He's alive.

1278
02:19:36,492 --> 02:19:39,446
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1279
02:19:39,662 --> 02:19:41,867
You should be dead.

1280
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:44,574
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1281
02:19:44,794 --> 02:19:49,538
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.

1282
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:56,459
Mithril.

1283
02:19:59,266 --> 02:20:01,886
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1284
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,810
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

1285
02:20:24,875 --> 02:20:26,535
This way!

1286
02:21:36,909 --> 02:21:39,908
What is this new devilry?

1287
02:21:55,969 --> 02:21:58,756
A Balrog.

1288
02:21:59,098 --> 02:22:02,215
A demon of the ancient world.

1289
02:22:04,436 --> 02:22:06,842
This foe is beyond any of you.

1290
02:22:08,022 --> 02:22:09,602
Run!

1291
02:22:16,949 --> 02:22:18,444
Quickly!

1292
02:22:35,053 --> 02:22:36,332
Gandalf.

1293
02:22:36,970 --> 02:22:38,547
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1294
02:22:39,974 --> 02:22:42,464
The bridge is near.

1295
02:22:44,519 --> 02:22:48,647
Do as I say! Swords are no more use here.

1296
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,504
Gandalf!

1297
02:23:37,781 --> 02:23:39,027
Merry! Pippin!

1298
02:23:50,129 --> 02:23:51,670
Sam!

1299
02:23:54,383 --> 02:23:57,633
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1300
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:02,092
Not the beard!

1301
02:24:15,322 --> 02:24:17,230
Steady.

1302
02:24:19,324 --> 02:24:20,984
Hold on!

1303
02:24:42,056 --> 02:24:43,255
Hang on!

1304
02:24:54,027 --> 02:24:55,769
Lean forward!

1305
02:24:58,781 --> 02:24:59,813
Steady.

1306
02:25:01,119 --> 02:25:02,280
Come on!

1307
02:25:02,494 --> 02:25:03,244
Now!

1308
02:25:21,179 --> 02:25:23,006
Over the bridge!

1309
02:25:23,222 --> 02:25:24,800
Fly!

1310
02:26:09,395 --> 02:26:11,435
You cannot pass!

1311
02:26:11,648 --> 02:26:13,226
Gandalf!

1312
02:26:17,488 --> 02:26:22,364
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

1313
02:26:23,370 --> 02:26:27,153
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

1314
02:26:37,133 --> 02:26:39,091
Go back to the Shadow.

1315
02:26:46,934 --> 02:26:51,395
You shall not pass!

1316
02:27:18,551 --> 02:27:22,417
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1317
02:27:30,104 --> 02:27:32,559
Fly, you fools!

1318
02:27:36,694 --> 02:27:37,694
No!

1319
02:27:44,994 --> 02:27:47,151
Aragorn!

1320
02:28:44,471 --> 02:28:47,260
Legolas, get them up.

1321
02:28:51,355 --> 02:28:53,228
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1322
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:57,058
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.

1323
02:28:57,276 --> 02:29:00,609
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

1324
02:29:01,531 --> 02:29:04,815
Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up.

1325
02:29:06,328 --> 02:29:08,534
On your feet, Sam.

1326
02:29:08,872 --> 02:29:10,366
Frodo?

1327
02:29:12,419 --> 02:29:14,126
Frodo!

1328
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:09,178
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1329
02:30:09,935 --> 02:30:14,062
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.

1330
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:16,810
An Elf-witch...

1331
02:30:17,357 --> 02:30:20,231
of terrible power.

1332
02:30:20,779 --> 02:30:22,986
All who look upon her...

1333
02:30:23,199 --> 02:30:24,991
fall under her spell.

1334
02:30:25,201 --> 02:30:26,481
Frodo!

1335
02:30:28,745 --> 02:30:30,786
And are never seen again.

1336
02:30:30,998 --> 02:30:35,493
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

1337
02:30:35,710 --> 02:30:39,410
You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.

1338
02:30:39,631 --> 02:30:41,375
Mr. Frodo?

1339
02:30:46,681 --> 02:30:52,268
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1340
02:30:52,479 --> 02:30:57,021
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1341
02:31:04,698 --> 02:31:09,278
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

1342
02:31:14,418 --> 02:31:16,411
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1343
02:31:17,338 --> 02:31:20,006
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1344
02:31:22,802 --> 02:31:24,509
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1345
02:31:25,136 --> 02:31:26,548
you are known to us.

1346
02:31:27,431 --> 02:31:29,672
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves!

1347
02:31:29,891 --> 02:31:31,764
Speak words we can all understand!

1348
02:31:31,977 --> 02:31:36,556
We have not had dealings with
the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1349
02:31:36,816 --> 02:31:39,354
And you know what this Dwarf says to that?

1350
02:31:46,199 --> 02:31:48,157
That was not so courteous.

1351
02:31:54,708 --> 02:31:58,756
You bring great evil with you.

1352
02:32:00,507 --> 02:32:02,714
You can go no further.

1353
02:32:40,130 --> 02:32:42,751
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1354
02:32:43,884 --> 02:32:45,795
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1355
02:32:47,305 --> 02:32:50,639
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1356
02:32:51,476 --> 02:32:54,596
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1357
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:59,480
You will follow me.

1358
02:33:11,205 --> 02:33:13,163
Caras Galadhon.

1359
02:33:13,791 --> 02:33:16,708
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1360
02:33:16,918 --> 02:33:22,589
Realm of the Lord Celeborn and
of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1361
02:34:41,713 --> 02:34:44,797
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1362
02:34:45,466 --> 02:34:50,629
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1363
02:34:52,391 --> 02:34:56,804
Eight there are here, yet nine
there were set out from Rivendell.

1364
02:34:57,062 --> 02:34:58,855
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1365
02:34:59,065 --> 02:35:02,150
For I much desire to speak with him.

1366
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:05,147
I can no longer see him from afar.

1367
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:11,191
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.

1368
02:35:11,452 --> 02:35:13,909
He has fallen into Shadow.

1369
02:35:18,585 --> 02:35:23,080
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1370
02:35:24,759 --> 02:35:28,458
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1371
02:35:29,178 --> 02:35:32,548
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1372
02:35:34,685 --> 02:35:37,935
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1373
02:35:38,564 --> 02:35:41,850
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1374
02:35:46,614 --> 02:35:50,908
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dum fill your heart...

1375
02:35:51,118 --> 02:35:53,444
Gimli, son of Gloin.

1376
02:35:54,455 --> 02:35:57,988
For the world has grown full of peril...

1377
02:35:59,459 --> 02:36:02,084
and in all lands...

1378
02:36:02,297 --> 02:36:05,797
love is now mingled with grief.

1379
02:36:18,438 --> 02:36:21,143
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1380
02:36:21,691 --> 02:36:24,692
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1381
02:36:27,656 --> 02:36:30,906
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1382
02:36:31,119 --> 02:36:34,202
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1383
02:36:34,955 --> 02:36:37,791
to the ruin of all.

1384
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:47,964
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.

1385
02:36:49,511 --> 02:36:54,259
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest...

1386
02:36:54,684 --> 02:36:58,349
for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1387
02:37:00,607 --> 02:37:02,730
Tonight, you will sleep...

1388
02:37:03,025 --> 02:37:06,441
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1389
02:37:07,906 --> 02:37:09,697
one who has seen the Eye!

1390
02:37:24,341 --> 02:37:26,912
A lament for Gandalf.

1391
02:37:34,182 --> 02:37:35,724
What do they say about him?

1392
02:37:35,976 --> 02:37:38,596
I have not the heart to tell you.

1393
02:37:41,482 --> 02:37:43,725
For me, the grief is still too near.

1394
02:37:46,696 --> 02:37:49,483
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1395
02:37:49,699 --> 02:37:52,734
There should be a verse about them.

1396
02:37:56,288 --> 02:37:58,282
The finest rockets ever seen

1397
02:37:59,416 --> 02:38:02,251
They burst in stars of blue and green

1398
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:08,379
Or after thunder, silver showers

1399
02:38:09,093 --> 02:38:11,845
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1400
02:38:12,055 --> 02:38:15,969
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1401
02:38:26,652 --> 02:38:27,612
Take some rest.

1402
02:38:29,532 --> 02:38:32,201
These borders are well-protected.

1403
02:38:32,410 --> 02:38:34,947
I will find no rest here.

1404
02:38:37,791 --> 02:38:40,790
I heard her voice inside my head.

1405
02:38:41,126 --> 02:38:44,744
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1406
02:38:44,962 --> 02:38:50,419
She said to me, "Even now there is hope left."

1407
02:38:51,804 --> 02:38:54,639
But I cannot see it.

1408
02:38:55,974 --> 02:38:58,466
It is long since we had any hope.

1409
02:39:08,654 --> 02:39:10,776
My father is a noble man.

1410
02:39:11,574 --> 02:39:13,781
But his rule is failing...

1411
02:39:16,911 --> 02:39:19,536
and our people lose faith.

1412
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:24,458
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.

1413
02:39:24,672 --> 02:39:28,206
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1414
02:39:31,053 --> 02:39:34,054
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1415
02:39:34,681 --> 02:39:36,674
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1416
02:39:36,891 --> 02:39:40,724
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1417
02:39:41,396 --> 02:39:44,897
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1418
02:39:47,778 --> 02:39:49,736
Have you ever been called home...

1419
02:39:49,947 --> 02:39:53,861
by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1420
02:39:54,493 --> 02:39:57,744
I have seen the White City...

1421
02:39:58,079 --> 02:39:59,575
long ago.

1422
02:40:00,541 --> 02:40:05,498
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1423
02:40:06,465 --> 02:40:09,382
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1424
02:40:09,843 --> 02:40:13,176
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1425
02:41:20,374 --> 02:41:22,864
Will you look into the mirror?

1426
02:41:23,085 --> 02:41:24,627
What will I see?

1427
02:41:27,589 --> 02:41:29,914
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1428
02:41:30,842 --> 02:41:32,669
For the mirror...

1429
02:41:32,886 --> 02:41:35,424
shows many things.

1430
02:41:38,433 --> 02:41:40,805
Things that were...

1431
02:41:41,018 --> 02:41:43,591
things that are...

1432
02:41:44,357 --> 02:41:46,315
and some things...

1433
02:41:49,904 --> 02:41:53,237
that have not yet come to pass.

1434
02:43:15,783 --> 02:43:18,617
I know what it is you saw.

1435
02:43:21,122 --> 02:43:23,615
For it is also in my mind.

1436
02:43:25,419 --> 02:43:29,463
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

1437
02:43:31,842 --> 02:43:36,718
The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun.

1438
02:43:37,348 --> 02:43:40,632
He will try to take the Ring.

1439
02:43:40,850 --> 02:43:42,843
You know of whom I speak.

1440
02:43:43,853 --> 02:43:48,516
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1441
02:43:50,027 --> 02:43:52,483
If you ask it of me...

1442
02:43:52,865 --> 02:43:55,947
I will give you the One Ring.

1443
02:43:56,992 --> 02:43:59,152
You offer it to me freely?

1444
02:44:03,749 --> 02:44:07,663
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.

1445
02:44:14,053 --> 02:44:17,337
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen...

1446
02:44:17,806 --> 02:44:21,589
not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!

1447
02:44:22,227 --> 02:44:25,262
Treacherous as the sea!

1448
02:44:25,771 --> 02:44:30,682
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1449
02:44:31,151 --> 02:44:33,524
All shall love me...

1450
02:44:33,737 --> 02:44:36,574
and despair.

1451
02:44:50,673 --> 02:44:55,001
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1452
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:57,715
and go into the West...

1453
02:44:57,929 --> 02:45:02,391
- and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1454
02:45:06,022 --> 02:45:10,150
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1455
02:45:11,068 --> 02:45:12,564
is to be alone.

1456
02:45:15,906 --> 02:45:18,657
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.

1457
02:45:18,867 --> 02:45:20,445
And I am its keeper.

1458
02:45:23,663 --> 02:45:27,284
This task was appointed to you.

1459
02:45:28,336 --> 02:45:31,207
And if you do not find a way...

1460
02:45:32,423 --> 02:45:34,416
no one will.

1461
02:45:34,802 --> 02:45:37,967
Then I know what I must do.

1462
02:45:38,638 --> 02:45:39,836
It's just...

1463
02:45:43,101 --> 02:45:45,342
I'm afraid to do it.

1464
02:45:48,856 --> 02:45:53,983
Even the smallest person can
change the course of the future.

1465
02:45:59,326 --> 02:46:05,080
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?

1466
02:46:05,834 --> 02:46:09,165
They were Elves once.

1467
02:46:10,337 --> 02:46:13,672
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1468
02:46:13,884 --> 02:46:17,050
tortured and mutilated.

1469
02:46:17,388 --> 02:46:22,677
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1470
02:46:22,976 --> 02:46:24,803
And now...

1471
02:46:26,271 --> 02:46:28,144
perfected.

1472
02:46:28,857 --> 02:46:32,024
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1473
02:46:33,986 --> 02:46:36,274
whom do you serve?

1474
02:46:36,488 --> 02:46:38,982
Saruman!

1475
02:46:59,845 --> 02:47:03,264
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.

1476
02:47:03,477 --> 02:47:06,394
You do not know pain. You do not know fear.

1477
02:47:06,604 --> 02:47:09,558
You will taste Man-flesh!

1478
02:47:14,612 --> 02:47:18,277
One of the halflings carries something of great value.

1479
02:47:18,491 --> 02:47:22,701
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1480
02:47:24,496 --> 02:47:25,777
Kill the others.

1481
02:47:44,977 --> 02:47:50,432
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1482
02:47:51,568 --> 02:47:55,351
May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.

1483
02:48:02,579 --> 02:48:04,203
Lembas.

1484
02:48:04,413 --> 02:48:06,038
Elvish waybread.

1485
02:48:08,542 --> 02:48:11,543
One small bite is enough to
fill the stomach of a grown man.

1486
02:48:18,012 --> 02:48:19,920
How many did you eat?

1487
02:48:20,138 --> 02:48:21,799
Four.

1488
02:48:27,603 --> 02:48:30,177
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1489
02:48:30,398 --> 02:48:34,477
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.

1490
02:48:34,693 --> 02:48:37,184
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1491
02:48:37,405 --> 02:48:41,191
Strange creatures bearing the White
Hand have been seen on our borders.

1492
02:48:41,411 --> 02:48:46,488
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1493
02:48:55,173 --> 02:48:57,746
You are being tracked.

1494
02:48:59,177 --> 02:49:03,803
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1495
02:49:21,116 --> 02:49:25,861
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1496
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:29,581
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1497
02:49:34,964 --> 02:49:37,372
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1498
02:49:37,592 --> 02:49:41,542
They have already seen service in war.

1499
02:49:41,763 --> 02:49:44,005
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1500
02:49:44,224 --> 02:49:47,509
You will find your courage.

1501
02:49:49,395 --> 02:49:51,352
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1502
02:49:51,564 --> 02:49:54,057
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1503
02:49:54,277 --> 02:49:56,399
Thank you, my lady.

1504
02:49:58,239 --> 02:50:01,572
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1505
02:50:07,997 --> 02:50:10,999
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?

1506
02:50:11,209 --> 02:50:11,929
Nothing.

1507
02:50:13,962 --> 02:50:17,295
Except to look upon the lady of
the Galadhrim one last time...

1508
02:50:17,923 --> 02:50:23,133
for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

1509
02:50:30,188 --> 02:50:31,730
Actually...

1510
02:50:31,939 --> 02:50:33,563
There was one thing.

1511
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:37,021
No, no, I couldn't. It's quite impossible.

1512
02:50:37,236 --> 02:50:40,023
Stupid to ask.

1513
02:50:42,575 --> 02:50:44,652
I have nothing greater to give...

1514
02:50:44,870 --> 02:50:48,452
than the gift you already bear.

1515
02:50:49,709 --> 02:50:50,740
For her love,

1516
02:50:52,044 --> 02:50:57,383
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

1517
02:50:58,175 --> 02:51:01,461
I would have her leave these shores,

1518
02:51:03,012 --> 02:51:05,930
and be with her people.

1519
02:51:07,936 --> 02:51:13,641
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1520
02:51:13,941 --> 02:51:16,978
That choice is yet before her.

1521
02:51:17,736 --> 02:51:20,606
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1522
02:51:20,948 --> 02:51:26,737
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

1523
02:51:26,954 --> 02:51:31,283
or to fall into darkness with
all that is left of your kin.

1524
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:39,829
Farewell.

1525
02:51:43,722 --> 02:51:47,091
There is much you have yet to do.

1526
02:51:53,606 --> 02:51:54,851
We shall not meet again...

1527
02:51:55,065 --> 02:51:56,442
Elessar.

1528
02:51:58,863 --> 02:52:02,029
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1529
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:05,657
I give you the light of Earendil...

1530
02:52:06,412 --> 02:52:08,737
our most beloved star.

1531
02:52:17,881 --> 02:52:22,295
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1532
02:52:22,512 --> 02:52:26,640
when all other lights go out.

1533
02:52:35,608 --> 02:52:38,774
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

1534
02:52:39,404 --> 02:52:43,696
having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1535
02:52:44,450 --> 02:52:47,785
Henceforth I will call nothing
fair unless it be her gift to me.

1536
02:52:48,039 --> 02:52:49,948
What was her gift?

1537
02:52:50,166 --> 02:52:55,077
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1538
02:52:55,880 --> 02:52:58,749
She gave me three.

1539
02:54:40,945 --> 02:54:44,361
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1540
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:51,204
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1541
02:54:51,457 --> 02:54:54,624
But he's too clever a waterman.

1542
02:54:55,461 --> 02:54:58,711
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1543
02:54:58,923 --> 02:55:01,129
it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1544
02:55:01,342 --> 02:55:03,380
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1545
02:55:03,592 --> 02:55:06,630
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1546
02:55:06,847 --> 02:55:09,966
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1547
02:55:10,892 --> 02:55:13,895
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1548
02:55:14,148 --> 02:55:15,310
But you're not.

1549
02:55:15,606 --> 02:55:18,061
I'm here to help you.

1550
02:55:18,275 --> 02:55:19,984
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1551
02:55:25,950 --> 02:55:28,702
You can't help me, Sam.

1552
02:55:30,829 --> 02:55:32,573
Not this time.

1553
02:55:35,459 --> 02:55:37,584
Get some sleep.

1554
02:55:43,801 --> 02:55:46,009
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1555
02:55:46,555 --> 02:55:49,305
You know that. From there we can regroup.

1556
02:55:49,974 --> 02:55:52,216
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1557
02:55:52,477 --> 02:55:55,347
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1558
02:55:55,814 --> 02:55:57,806
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.

1559
02:55:59,691 --> 02:56:02,480
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1560
02:56:02,697 --> 02:56:05,651
Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty.

1561
02:56:05,867 --> 02:56:09,200
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1562
02:56:09,411 --> 02:56:11,618
But you will not see that.

1563
02:56:11,955 --> 02:56:13,366
You are afraid!

1564
02:56:13,624 --> 02:56:16,197
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1565
02:56:16,460 --> 02:56:19,910
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1566
02:56:22,340 --> 02:56:26,719
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1567
02:56:38,566 --> 02:56:39,894
Frodo.

1568
02:56:41,777 --> 02:56:43,272
The Argonath.

1569
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:50,443
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1570
02:56:51,205 --> 02:56:53,115
My kin.

1571
02:58:12,163 --> 02:58:14,369
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1572
02:58:14,580 --> 02:58:17,155
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1573
02:58:17,376 --> 02:58:20,827
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1574
02:58:21,172 --> 02:58:24,955
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1575
02:58:25,175 --> 02:58:28,426
an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1576
02:58:28,638 --> 02:58:31,723
And after that, it gets even better.

1577
02:58:32,142 --> 02:58:37,018
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1578
02:58:37,230 --> 02:58:38,641
That is our road.

1579
02:58:40,190 --> 02:58:43,357
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1580
02:58:43,569 --> 02:58:45,312
Recover my...

1581
02:58:48,324 --> 02:58:50,280
- We should leave now.
- No.

1582
02:58:50,492 --> 02:58:54,907
Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We
must wait for cover of darkness.

1583
02:58:55,124 --> 02:58:58,575
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1584
02:58:58,794 --> 02:59:02,792
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.

1585
02:59:03,298 --> 02:59:07,510
Something draws near. I can feel it.

1586
02:59:09,471 --> 02:59:14,428
Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1587
02:59:14,933 --> 02:59:16,642
Where's Frodo?

1588
02:59:42,297 --> 02:59:44,206
None of us should wander alone.

1589
02:59:45,592 --> 02:59:47,715
You, least of all.

1590
02:59:47,928 --> 02:59:50,383
So much depends on you.

1591
02:59:51,430 --> 02:59:52,150
Frodo?

1592
03:00:00,482 --> 03:00:03,054
I know why you seek solitude.

1593
03:00:03,776 --> 03:00:07,194
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1594
03:00:07,991 --> 03:00:11,074
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1595
03:00:12,702 --> 03:00:15,373
There are other ways, Frodo.

1596
03:00:15,582 --> 03:00:19,413
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1597
03:00:19,627 --> 03:00:23,411
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1598
03:00:23,631 --> 03:00:26,714
Warning? Against what?

1599
03:00:26,925 --> 03:00:29,047
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1600
03:00:29,261 --> 03:00:32,880
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1601
03:00:33,099 --> 03:00:36,884
- don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1602
03:00:38,646 --> 03:00:41,979
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1603
03:00:43,567 --> 03:00:45,608
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1604
03:00:46,862 --> 03:00:50,527
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1605
03:00:52,326 --> 03:00:55,662
What chance do you think you have?

1606
03:00:55,873 --> 03:01:00,534
They will find you. They will take the Ring.

1607
03:01:00,753 --> 03:01:04,452
And you will beg for death before the end!

1608
03:01:06,592 --> 03:01:08,667
You fool!

1609
03:01:08,885 --> 03:01:12,834
It is not yours, save by unhappy
chance! It could have been mine.

1610
03:01:13,055 --> 03:01:15,843
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1611
03:01:16,058 --> 03:01:17,303
- Give it to me!
- No!

1612
03:01:17,519 --> 03:01:19,345
- Give it to me!
- No.

1613
03:01:26,988 --> 03:01:29,028
I see your mind.

1614
03:01:29,239 --> 03:01:32,195
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1615
03:01:32,409 --> 03:01:34,283
You will betray us!

1616
03:01:34,494 --> 03:01:37,699
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1617
03:01:38,123 --> 03:01:41,787
Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings!

1618
03:01:48,844 --> 03:01:50,385
Frodo?

1619
03:01:54,682 --> 03:01:56,259
Frodo.

1620
03:02:00,187 --> 03:02:02,226
What have I done?

1621
03:02:02,440 --> 03:02:04,147
Please, Frodo.

1622
03:02:04,358 --> 03:02:07,028
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1623
03:02:55,618 --> 03:02:57,030
Frodo?

1624
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:01,375
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1625
03:03:01,585 --> 03:03:03,376
Stay away!

1626
03:03:03,795 --> 03:03:05,374
Frodo!

1627
03:03:07,632 --> 03:03:11,465
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1628
03:03:21,146 --> 03:03:23,638
Would you destroy it?

1629
03:03:28,612 --> 03:03:30,570
Aragorn.

1630
03:03:33,993 --> 03:03:36,319
Aragorn.

1631
03:03:38,121 --> 03:03:39,995
Elessar.

1632
03:03:47,633 --> 03:03:51,002
I would have gone with you to the end.

1633
03:03:51,679 --> 03:03:54,513
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1634
03:03:57,851 --> 03:03:59,014
I know.

1635
03:04:01,478 --> 03:04:06,936
Look after the others. Especially
Sam. He will not understand.

1636
03:04:10,696 --> 03:04:12,406
Go, Frodo!

1637
03:04:15,410 --> 03:04:16,905
Run!

1638
03:04:17,163 --> 03:04:18,823
Run!

1639
03:04:43,398 --> 03:04:45,057
Mr. Frodo!

1640
03:04:54,326 --> 03:04:56,117
Find the halfling!

1641
03:04:57,745 --> 03:05:00,284
Find the halfling!

1642
03:05:03,753 --> 03:05:05,412
Elendil!

1643
03:05:11,927 --> 03:05:13,468
Aragorn, go!

1644
03:05:35,201 --> 03:05:36,481
Frodo!

1645
03:05:37,077 --> 03:05:38,701
Hide here. Quick!

1646
03:05:39,330 --> 03:05:40,789
Come on!

1647
03:05:43,250 --> 03:05:45,290
What's he doing?

1648
03:05:49,508 --> 03:05:51,500
He's leaving.

1649
03:05:56,306 --> 03:05:59,222
- No!
- Pippin!

1650
03:06:04,146 --> 03:06:06,471
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1651
03:06:07,024 --> 03:06:10,143
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1652
03:06:10,527 --> 03:06:12,153
- Over here!
- This way!

1653
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,324
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1654
03:07:20,684 --> 03:07:23,769
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1655
03:08:06,857 --> 03:08:07,971
Run!

1656
03:11:39,576 --> 03:11:41,199
No.

1657
03:11:45,122 --> 03:11:48,159
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1658
03:11:48,417 --> 03:11:50,455
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1659
03:11:52,337 --> 03:11:53,797
I let Frodo go.

1660
03:11:54,464 --> 03:11:57,087
Then you did what I could not.

1661
03:11:58,094 --> 03:12:01,380
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1662
03:12:01,932 --> 03:12:06,178
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1663
03:12:06,393 --> 03:12:08,683
I did not see it.

1664
03:12:08,897 --> 03:12:12,399
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1665
03:12:13,261 --> 03:12:14,830
You fought bravely.

1666
03:12:15,663 --> 03:12:17,713
You have kept your honor.

1667
03:12:18,656 --> 03:12:20,531
Leave it.

1668
03:12:20,868 --> 03:12:22,944
It is over.

1669
03:12:24,164 --> 03:12:29,370
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1670
03:12:29,835 --> 03:12:32,835
and my city to ruin.

1671
03:12:36,884 --> 03:12:39,589
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

1672
03:12:39,804 --> 03:12:43,800
but I swear to you, I will
not let the White City fall...

1673
03:12:44,807 --> 03:12:47,300
nor our people fail.

1674
03:12:48,271 --> 03:12:49,647
Our people.

1675
03:12:53,484 --> 03:12:55,560
Our people.

1676
03:13:17,342 --> 03:13:20,343
I would have followed you, my brother.

1677
03:13:21,889 --> 03:13:23,881
My captain.

1678
03:13:26,518 --> 03:13:28,427
My king.

1679
03:13:48,081 --> 03:13:50,324
Be at peace...

1680
03:13:50,709 --> 03:13:52,702
son of Gondor.

1681
03:14:09,187 --> 03:14:12,521
They will look for his coming from the White Tower.

1682
03:14:13,024 --> 03:14:16,025
But he will not return.

1683
03:14:39,259 --> 03:14:39,979
Frodo!

1684
03:15:00,698 --> 03:15:03,984
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1685
03:15:05,244 --> 03:15:08,244
I wish none of this had happened.

1686
03:15:11,208 --> 03:15:13,961
So do all who live to see such times...

1687
03:15:14,172 --> 03:15:17,622
but that is not for them to decide.

1688
03:15:17,841 --> 03:15:20,463
All you have to decide...

1689
03:15:20,678 --> 03:15:25,423
is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1690
03:15:54,252 --> 03:15:56,329
Frodo, no!

1691
03:15:56,880 --> 03:15:58,160
Frodo!

1692
03:15:58,966 --> 03:16:01,636
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1693
03:16:05,181 --> 03:16:07,139
Go back, Sam!

1694
03:16:07,642 --> 03:16:11,226
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1695
03:16:11,438 --> 03:16:14,272
And I'm coming with you!

1696
03:16:14,774 --> 03:16:17,182
You can't swim!

1697
03:16:20,988 --> 03:16:22,697
Sam!

1698
03:16:28,289 --> 03:16:29,616
Sam!

1699
03:17:10,539 --> 03:17:13,244
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1700
03:17:13,583 --> 03:17:17,915
A promise: "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1701
03:17:19,050 --> 03:17:21,670
And I don't mean to.

1702
03:17:21,926 --> 03:17:24,085
I don't mean to.

1703
03:17:25,764 --> 03:17:26,764
Sam.

1704
03:17:42,490 --> 03:17:44,150
Come on.

1705
03:18:12,603 --> 03:18:17,147
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.

1706
03:18:32,040 --> 03:18:37,036
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1707
03:18:40,465 --> 03:18:45,341
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1708
03:18:57,192 --> 03:19:00,358
Not if we hold true to each other.

1709
03:19:01,738 --> 03:19:06,198
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1710
03:19:07,201 --> 03:19:12,444
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1711
03:19:13,750 --> 03:19:15,741
We travel light.

1712
03:19:15,959 --> 03:19:17,871
Let us hunt some Orc.

1713
03:19:20,842 --> 03:19:21,592
Yes!

1714
03:19:41,863 --> 03:19:43,322
Mordor.

1715
03:19:43,949 --> 03:19:47,316
I hope the others find a safer road.

1716
03:19:48,243 --> 03:19:50,817
Strider will look after them.

1717
03:19:51,746 --> 03:19:55,116
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1718
03:19:55,459 --> 03:19:57,866
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1719
03:19:58,086 --> 03:19:59,664
We may.

1720
03:20:01,715 --> 03:20:02,793
Sam...

1721
03:20:06,388 --> 03:20:09,009
I'm glad you are with me.
