# Movie Scripts

There are quite a few resources available to get some inspiration about the "Lord of the Rings" movie scripts.
Each one has its own advantages and drawbacks.

## Official Scripts

Script Slug has [all three scripts](https://www.scriptslug.com/?q=the+lord+of+the+rings) available for download.
These documents seem to be (at least semi-) official, are formatted accordingly.

The scripts do not include the extended scenes.
They differ in format, quality and detail.
Some half-sentences within these scripts didn't make it into the final movies.

Here's a not too well OCR-scanned txt version of them: [FOTR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eDubrovsky/movie_scripts/master/Lord-of-the-Rings-Fellowship-of-the-Ring%2C-The.txt), [TTT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eDubrovsky/movie_scripts/master/Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers.txt), [ROTK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eDubrovsky/movie_scripts/master/Lord-of-the-Rings-Return-of-the-King.txt)

## Age of the Ring

A fan site offering [scripts](http://www.ageofthering.com/atthemovies/) for the extended editions of the movies.

Unfortunately, scenes 38 to 46 of FOTR are missing.
According to the [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/changes/https://www.ageofthering.com/atthemovies/scripts/fellowshipoftheringscript.php), the page is not enhancing anymore.
The authors do not reply and the forum seems to be orphaned.

## The Council of Elrond

The website offers many Tolkien related resources, including [fan-written movie scripts](https://www.councilofelrond.com/subjectcats/film-scripts/).

The page is actively maintained, updated regularly, the forum is online and contains relatively new postings.

## Tolkien Gateway

This [Wiki](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Portal:Adaptations) includes some scene information.

## A Hobbit's Tale

A fan page dedicated to collect and present LOTR related information including [the movie scripts](https://web.archive.org/web/20080206162450/http://www.warofthering.net/ahobbitstale/movies/movies.htm).

## Kluever Augsburg

There's a German version [at Kluever Augsburg](http://www.kluever-augsburg.de/maria/hdr/drehbuch/indexdrehbuecher.html) available as well.

It doesn't include too many actions but is under active development.
I'll contact the guys as soon as it seems fitting.

To be honest, I would like to have a German movie script as well.
Maybe I'll start using a machine translation for the action elements and copy the dialogues from the German subtitles.

## TK421

A nerdy website by John Hubbard including a rather [well formatted version](https://www.tk421.net/lotr/film/) of the extended movie scripts.

It is compiled from various sources, but the scene separation is different.
This is the one I initially took to have a working copy and Proof-of-Concept version.
