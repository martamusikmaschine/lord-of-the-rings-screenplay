# TL;DR

This is a work-in-progress project.
The work is not done yet.
You are invited to help me.

"The Lord of the Rings" Screenplay:
The most recent version as PDF file](/releases).

You can find different versions [here](release).

They are based on [TK421's](https://www.tk421.net/lotr/film/) film scripts.
Slightly adjusted versions used as a **template** (i.e. it does **not** meet my formatting and style criteria) can be found here:

* [The Fellowship of the Ring](scenes/lotr_1_fotr/template/lotr_1_fotr.template.pdf)
* [The Two Towers](scenes/lotr_2_ttt/template/lotr_2_ttt.template.pdf)
* [The Return of the King](scenes/lotr_3_rotk/template/lotr_3_rotk.template.pdf)

# Idea

My goal is to offer an easy to read, well formatted screenplay of the motion picture trilogy "The Lord of the Rings" by Peter Jackson in its extended edition.

# Motivation

I always wanted to have a printed version of the movies while watching them.
Following the movies with a script at hand, I would mark important quotes (i.e. quasi everything), add trivia facts, book differences, film-theoretical elements like plot points, mark my favorite scenes, add statistics, movie timestamps, extended scenes and whatever comes to mind. It would be a living document.

Eventually, all the info and handwritten notes could flow back into the source and everyone could print their own version with a hand chosen set of extra stuff.

# Movie Scripts

There's already n different projects dedicated to compiling the content of the LOTR motion picture trilogy.
This is n+1.

Find out more about the alternatives [here](movie_scripts.md).

# File Formats

There's plenty of different file formats and technical decisions to be made.

Read about them [here](file_formats.md).

# Rules

Be sure to read the editing [rules](rules.md) before doing anything.

By applying rather strict rules about what should and shouldn't be included, a fixed format and specification of a certain style of writing, I hope to get a homogeneous final product.
The 'source files' can later be automatically transformed into multiple output formats and documents.

A screenplay itself has a set of rules that every writer should oblige.
These rules are slightly different to the ones I encourage, although the format is almost exactly the same.

# Resources

Before trying to work on anything in this project, learn a little bit about screenwriting.
There's tons of information available, the most important topic for our use-case is formatting and writing style.

# Workflow

1. Choose a scene you want to dedicate your time to (via Github issue)
2. Create a branch for that scene
3. Copy the template `fountain` file from the template directory into the `production` folder
4. Open the file as this will be the fruit of your labor
5. Open the 'original' screenplay and subtitle document
6. Browse a few Wiki pages and other inspirations for writing (names, places, ...)
7. Start the movie with subtitles and fast forward to the chosen scene
8. Follow the scene a few seconds and carefully compare all sources
9. Edit the `fountain` file according to the rules and style tips
10. Repeat steps 8 & 9 until the whole scene is done
11. Create a PDF of your scene
12. Start the whole scene from the beginning
13. Follow attentively
14. Compare your result with the previous and next scene (if available) and check if it fits well
15. Go back to 9 and apply necessary changes
16. Compile the updated release files
17. Merge with main
