Fighting continues at Minas Tirith. The battering ram Grond pulls up to the outer city gates. Trolls pull back the ram and let it slam into the gate.

ORCS
Grond! Grond!

Orcs exchange volleys with archers above the gate. Gandalf, again mounted on Shadowfax, rallies the soldiers to the gate.

GANDALF
Back to the gate! Hurry!
