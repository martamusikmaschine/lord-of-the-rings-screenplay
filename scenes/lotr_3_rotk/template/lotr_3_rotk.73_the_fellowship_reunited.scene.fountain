Frodo wakes up in a soft bed.
He sits up and sees Gandalf for the first time since Moria. Frodo smiles and laughs.

FRODO
Gandalf?

Gandalf laughs.
Merry and Pippin enter the room and run to Frodo.

MERRY
Frodo!

Gimli enters, waving his arms.

FRODO
Gimli!
Aragorn.

Sam enters last, exchanging a knowing look with Frodo.
