All is quiet.
The King of the Dead stands before Aragorn.

KING OF THE DEAD
Release us.

GIMLI
Bad idea.
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead.

KING OF THE DEAD
You gave us your word!

ARAGORN
I hold your oath fulfilled. Go, be at peace.

The dead army dissipates into the wind.
Gandalf bows to the new king.
